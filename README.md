## Writing

### Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs)

#### Background

Audio classification involves the extraction of various audio features, and MFCCs play a crucial role in representing the spectral characteristics of audio signals. This section provides an in-depth explanation of MFCCs, their significance, steps for calculation, and real-life applications.

#### Real Life Applications of MFCCs

- Emotion Recognition
- Music Genre Classification
- Speech Recognition
- Speaker Identification
- Environmental Sound Classification

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

#### Background

CNNs, designed for multi-dimensional data analysis, are explored in the context of audio classification. This section covers the layers of CNNs and techniques to make them suitable for 1D audio data.

#### Real Life Examples of CNNs

- Speech Recognition
- Emotion Recognition
- Language Recognition
- Environmental Sound Classification

## App Development

Imagine developing a mobile application that enables users to record their voices, apply audio effects, and classify the resulting sound using an API. This section describes the architecture of the app, key components, functionalities, and provides a simple example for recording voice.

## Machine Learning

### Emotion Detection System

For a real-life project involving the development of an audio classification system to identify the speaker's emotion, this section outlines the approach from data collection and preprocessing to model building, evaluation, and deployment.

### Challenges

Identifies and discusses potential challenges in building an emotion detection system and suggests solutions to mitigate them.
